"Alex is a lesser injury than what we thought so we'll see in the morning if he's ready to play tomorrow.

"Dominic's had a good week. We played three games in six days going into Man United, so we had to be careful with that one.

"He's in a good place, he's had a nice week's training, we're managing him as well as we possibly can - he's fit.

"Andros is still a few weeks away. Because it's been a difficult injury, I'll come back when he's getting close as I don't want to put pressure on him but hopefully he's a few weeks away."
