Sean Dyche says Dominic Calvert-Lewin will not be available for Everton's clash with Leeds United on Saturday afternoon (3pm GMT). 

A hamstring concern meant the striker was withdrawn after an hour in the 1-0 win against Arsenal two weeks ago and he was an omission for Monday night's Merseyside derby.

The boss also provided updates on James Garner and Nathan Patterson, with both edging closer to a return and set to feature for Paul Tait's Under-21 side tomorrow night. 

"A couple of the lads will play tomorrow, which I am going to watch," said Dyche. 

"Jimmy will play tomorrow, and Patto (Nathan Patterson) will play as well. So I will get over and watch them for the first time. 

"They are not there yet, but they have been on the grass with us. Next is to put it into game practice." 

Andros Townsend (ACL) remains unavailable.
