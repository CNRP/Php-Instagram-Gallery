“I love Everton. How can I not?

“It makes me very proud to represent this club, a big club.

“From the first day I arrived, everyone welcomed me with open arms. My mind was blown, to be honest. I remember walking around the training ground and everyone was welcoming me... ‘Alright, lad!’... ‘You good, son?’... It was a lot to take in but it meant everything to me.

“I love my teammates - every one of them - and all of the staff here. The fans, too. I think they have respect for me and I have incredible respect for them.

“I like Liverpool as a city.

“I like to go for a walk around the city sometimes and I enjoy the restaurants, too.

“Now it’s a little different but I liked in the first month or two I could walk around and nobody knew me.

“When my father visited me, we drove into the city centre to go to Everton Two in Liverpool One. It was a crazy feeling because as we entered the shop it felt like I’d just walked into my house where all my friends were waiting for me.

“Everyone welcomed me... ‘How’s it going, Myko?’... I’m quite a quiet guy and I like to keep myself to myself, so I love that they have that relationship with me but I also feel quite shy!

“My dad was completely shocked that everyone knew me, everyone knew my name and wanted to make sure I was okay.

“Of course, we’d spoken about what it was like but for him to see it for himself took him by surprise.

“He told me afterwards that it makes him very proud that I am part of such a big club and I think that gave him another glimpse of what sort of club Everton is.”
