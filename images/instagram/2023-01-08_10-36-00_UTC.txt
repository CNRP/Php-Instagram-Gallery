Alex Iwobi is expected to be out for around three weeks with the ankle ligament injury sustained against Manchester United on Friday.

The Everton midfielder was taken off on a stretcher early in the second half of the FA Cup tie at Old Trafford.

Scan results on Saturday confirmed a lateral ligament injury that will be managed conservatively by the Clubâ€™s medical team at Finch Farm.
