â€œWe have to be pushing each other every single day on the training pitch â€” I think thatâ€™s where winners and losers are made.

â€œTraining has to be competitive at all times, not to the point where youâ€™re kicking lumps out of each other but in terms of being desperate to win, being desperate to contribute with a goal or an assist or a block or a tackle. Thatâ€™s where it starts.

â€œIf you have that every day in training then it becomes normal to carry that on at the weekend. Thatâ€™s where weâ€™re getting to.

â€œThe gaffer helps with that competitiveness and thereâ€™s little forfeits in the sessions that you donâ€™t want to be on the end of â€” nose flicks, ear flicks and all kinds!

â€œItâ€™s up to us as players to take the responsibility to carry that through and weâ€™re doing absolutely everything we can to ensure that is the case.

"I love Tarky. Heâ€™s class... One of my best mates.

"I knew about Tarky before I came to the club â€” Iâ€™ve played against him loads of times before and I knew how much of a top player he is.

"Iâ€™ve had good battles against him in the past but now coming in and experiencing him every single day â€” the sort of character he is, the sort of friend he is, the sort of player he isâ€¦ Heâ€™s huge for us.

"Heâ€™s a big part of the dressing room and Iâ€™ve grown close to him over the months weâ€™ve been here.

"I think heâ€™s brilliant in terms of what he brings and how he holds himself."
