"It was a massive performance, a massive win in front of our fans. 

"It's good for the confidence. We won this game because of our mentality and our work ethic. I'm very, very proud of this team.

"I think it's partly in what the new staff did and what they've brought in. They bring a good energy, a good atmosphere and they've talked about the mentality that we must have out on the pitch. 

"They require the maximum - that is the minimum!

"I think it's obvious [how comfortable I am here].

"Everyone can see how much fun I have when I play at Goodison. They give us so much drive and from the bottom of my heart I want to thank them for their support today and the past few months, because I know it's been tough. 

"The fans push us to the limit, to our best. They push me to my limit. Their support is massive.

"I know I've still got a lot to learn, a lot of work to do but I'm very confident and I'm just trying to help the team as much as I can and give my best every week. It starts in training and that's what you see out there.

"The important thing now is to focus as fast as we can on the next game.

‚ÄúYou know how football is, you can beat Arsenal then lose the next one so I really want everyone in the team to focus as quickly as possible and prepare well for the next game.

"It's a massive boost. It's a big one for the confidence of the team but now we have Liverpool next.‚Äù
