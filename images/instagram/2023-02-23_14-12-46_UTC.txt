Amadou Onana is fit and available but Dominic Calvert-Lewin is set to miss Everton's clash with Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday (3pm).

Onana was withdrawn with a knee problem 64 minutes into the 1-0 win over Leeds United last time out but, speaking in his pre-match press conference on Thursday, manager Sean Dyche has confirmed the Belgium midfielder will be available for this weekend.

Calvert-Lewin, meanwhile, has missed the Blues' past two games with a hamstring complaint, with Dyche last week revealing the striker would be given time to achieve his optimal condition.

Discussing Calvert-Lewin's current condition, Dyche said: "He's building up well. He's not with us [training] yet but I think that will come quite quickly. 

"Our intention is to get him as fit as possible so we can break this spell of ups and downs with injuries.

"We want all of our players - not just Dominic - fit and available."

James Garner and Nathan Patterson stepped up their recoveries from back and knee injuries respectively with minutes in the Under-21s' 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur last Friday.

Dyche revealed Patterson has since suffered a minor issue, which has prevented him from training with the full group this week but says the pair are closing in on a return.

Andros Townsend (ACL) remains unavailable, with Dyche confirming the winger needs a "bit more time" before being ready to return.
