Being an Evertonian in America used to be a lonely existence and, for some, it continues to be. 

Personally, I think that’s one of the things that draws us in when the love affair with this club begins. 

We saw it in the fight to avoid relegation last season... The scenes at Leicester away, the bus greetings, that night against Palace. I don’t know how anyone could watch those scenes and see that level of devotion beamed across the world and not want to feel it and be a part of it. 

After being 'chosen' some 15 or so years ago, I spent much of my early existence as the only Everton supporter I knew. I had a few friends who became casual (and now die-hard) fans mostly because they were intrigued by something I would never shut up about. 

But I’d never talked to anyone who’d lived and breathed the club as long as I had unless I was on Twitter.

After a life-changing pilgrimage to Goodison Park in 2013, I became borderline obsessed with finding more people like me, who felt taken in by this club but isolated in America. 

The following year, my professional life took me from Texas over to a city just outside Atlanta, Georgia, and I found just what I was looking for. 

The Atlanta Evertonians gave me the blueprint for what I wanted. I only spent 18 months with them, but it engrained in me a desire to stop watching games alone in my apartment or at work. I was working in a crazy field, often stressful, and this group gave me a reprieve and a place where I could cut loose. 

Everton brought us together, but the community the club created had become addictive.

I later moved to Tennessee. The very first thing I did was seek out the Nashville Evertonians. With our new local soccer club starting up in Nashville, I figured it might be a prime opportunity to get something going, and a little over three years ago, we fully rebooted our group.

You’re coming to watch the match, sure, but you’re coming to be with your mates first and foremost. No one who follows this club in America is doing so because they’re glory-hunting. There’s something else about it, and to me, it’s that sense of belonging.
