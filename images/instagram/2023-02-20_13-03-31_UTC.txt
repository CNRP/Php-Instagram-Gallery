“It’s always good to get a win. It was a pretty quiet day for me, but I’m pleased with the clean sheet.

“I think everyone’s working hard to get a game after the refresh of the new manager. He’s big on keeping clean sheets and being hard to break down.

“The wingers have to defend and help the full-backs, and the defenders have to be strong, too.

“When Goodison’s rocking, it’s a special place to be.

"Of course, we'd rather have got that second goal to ease the pressure and see the game out, but, yes, 1-0 and a clean sheet. It's a great result.

"[Seamus' goal] was a good cross, wasn’t it?! He told us in the changing rooms he definitely meant it and it's a brilliant strike.

"The lads are buzzing for him and it was an important one for us.

“It’s been a refresh. Back to basics, in some respects, and it’s important we're defending our goal well and being hard to beat.

“We need to keep building our form now.

"We’ve been working extremely hard on the training pitch and that will continue because we want more.

"Aston Villa are a good side, but we'll put the work in and we'll be ready for the challenge.”

JP1. 💙
